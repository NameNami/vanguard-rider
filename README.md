## Problem & Solution Summary
**Problem:**  
- Collecting reliable real-time driving data is challenging due to device limitations, inconsistent connectivity, and privacy considerations.  
- Existing datasets are often limited or not tailored to local driving behavior.  
- Synchronizing multiple components (mobile app, MQTT broker, AI worker, and server) can introduce errors and delays.

**Solution:**  
- Use **HiveMQ** as the MQTT broker to handle real-time data streaming efficiently.  
- Build a mobile app to capture sensor data directly from users, ensuring dataset relevance and accuracy.  
- Implement proper Android permissions (fine location, notifications) to allow seamless data collection.  
- Process the incoming data with the **AI worker script** (`realtime_ai_worker.py`) to enable real-time analysis and dataset generation.  
- Centralize data storage on a server for easy management, monitoring, and future model training.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** (React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Backend:** (Python, Kotlin, HiveMQ, MQTT, OpenStreetMap API)

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the system, install the mobile app, and view the live telematics dashboard.

### 1. Set Up HiveMQ Cloud
1. Go to the [HiveMQ website](https://www.hivemq.com/).  
2. Create a **HiveMQ Cloud account** and log in.  
3. Create a **new Serverless Cluster**.  
4. From the **Overview** tab of your cluster, copy the **URL**.  
   - Later, you will prepend it with `ssl://` when entering into the app.  
5. In your cluster, go to the **Web Client** tab.  
6. Under **Connection Settings**, click **Connect with autogenerated credentials**.  
7. Copy the **Username** and **Password** provided.  
8. Click **Create and Connect** to finalize.  

### 2. Install and Configure the Mobile App
1. Obtain the APK file from this repository.  
2. Install the APK on your Android device.  
3. Open the app.  
4. When prompted, **grant permissions** for:
   - Fine Location  
   - Notifications  
5. In the app, go to **Broker Settings** and enter:  
   - **Broker URL** → paste the cluster URL (add `ssl://` at the front).  
   - **Username** → paste the copied username.  
   - **Password** → paste the copied password.  
6. Click **Save** to store the settings.  
7. Press **Start** to begin collecting live driving data.  

### 3. Set Up the Live Telematics Dashboard
1. On your computer, download the **project ZIP file** from GitHub and extract it.  
2. Open the file `realtime_ai_worker.py` in a text editor.  
3. Replace the placeholders with your HiveMQ information:  
   ```python
   MQTT_BROKER_URL = "ssl://your-cluster-url"
   MQTT_USERNAME = "your-username"
   MQTT_PASSWORD = "your-password"
   headers = { 'User-Agent': 'VanguardRider/1.0 (your-email@example.com)' }
4. Save the file.

### 4. Install Libraries 
1. Open the project root folder.
2. Open Command Prompt in that folder (type cmd in the folder path).
3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.text
4. Run the worker:
   ```bash
   python realtime_ai_worker.py

### 5. Open the Live Telematics Dashboard
1. Install Node.js if you haven’t already.
2. In the project folder, open the frontend directory.
3. Open Command Prompt in that folder (type cmd in the folder path).
4. Run: **npm start** to launch the live telematics dashboard in your browser.

## Reflection

### Challenges
- Integrating real-time data streams from the mobile device into the HiveMQ broker.  
- Ensuring stable connectivity between the mobile app, HiveMQ, and the AI worker.  
- Managing noise and inconsistencies in sensor data to improve event recognition accuracy.  
- Handling permission issues on Android devices (fine location, notifications).  
- Debugging synchronization between multiple system components (mobile app, server, AI worker).

### Learnings
- Gained experience in setting up and working with MQTT brokers (HiveMQ).  
- Improved understanding of real-time event detection using AI models.  
- Learned to handle Android permissions and how they impact data collection.  
- Developed teamwork and problem-solving skills while integrating multiple technologies.  
- Discovered the importance of dataset quality in training and testing AI models.
